# Portfolio
This portfolio was designed using Bootstrap. I created this in week 2 of being enrolled of my coding bootcamp after just having learned CSS for the first time. I do update it frequently so everything displayed in recent. 

All projects listed in my portfolio were created during my time as a student. I generally had a week to complete each project after having just learned the material within that same week. The only previous knowledge I had related to coding was very basic HTML I had learned from a communications professor at the University of Houston. However, his knowledge was so outdated he taught us to use tables to design pages. Needless to say, I've learned a lot since then. 

I'm looking forward to becoming a full-stack web developer once this course ends in July.
